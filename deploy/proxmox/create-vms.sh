# Run this ONCE, as root, on the Proxmox host, to create the two staging
# VMs (console, contestant) that the release workflow later deploys to.
#
# You need a raw-efi image for each already sitting on this host first —
# build them with `nix build .#console` / `nix build .#contestant` and
# copy result/nixos.img over, or grab one from a GitHub release. The
# image you import here becomes each VM's initial disk, so its size is
# what the CI deploy step's pre-flight size check will compare future
# builds against (see ci-deploy-image.sh) — if a later build changes
# size, that check will (correctly) refuse to deploy until you resize
# or recreate the VM's disk deliberately.
#
# Works with directory storage (e.g. Proxmox's default "local") or
# LVM-thin (e.g. "local-lvm") — the deploy step's disk-overwrite approach
# just needs `pvesm path` to resolve to something it can write raw bytes
# into directly, which holds for a plain file (dir/nfs/cifs) or a block
# device (lvmthin/lvm) alike. The script checks the pool is one of these
# and refuses to proceed otherwise.
